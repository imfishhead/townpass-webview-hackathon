The user-supplied `2026 城市通入門指引` workshop export is a dated event source, not a permanent TownPass specification. Its reusable 2026 requirements are summarized in [event-2026-fall.md](event-2026-fall.md). Re-check the organizer’s current rule sheet when the task affects eligibility, licensing, publication duration, AI, maps, or submission.

## Verified facts

The official Vue guideline and starter specify Node.js 18+, Vue 3 Composition API, Vue Router, Pinia, Tailwind CSS, `v-calendar`, Headless UI Dialog, `pnpm install`, `pnpm dev`, and a default local URL of `http://localhost:5173`. The 2026 workshop guide says the WebView page may use another language or framework, so treat Vue as the official starter rather than a competition-wide mandate.

The inspected official Flutter repo checkout uses Flutter `3.47.6` through `.fvmrc`, Dart `>=3.13.0 <4.0.0`, and `flutter_inappwebview ^6.1.5`. The repo’s `LICENSE` is GPL-3.0. Re-check these files instead of assuming the values remain current:

- `lib/util/tp_web_view.dart`
- `lib/util/web_message_handler/tp_web_message_listener.dart`
- `lib/util/web_message_handler/tp_web_message_handler.dart`
- `lib/util/web_message_handler/tp_web_message_reply.dart`
- `lib/util/tp_colors.dart`
- `lib/util/tp_text_styles.dart`
- `pubspec.yaml`
- `.fvmrc`
- `LICENSE`
- `lib/page/city_service/model/my_service_model.dart`
- `lib/page/city_service/model/trending_service_model.dart`

The host registers `flutterObject` with `addWebMessageListener`. Web messages and replies are stringified JSON objects with `name` and `data` keys. The verified method names are `userinfo`, `launch_map`, `phone_call`, `1999agree`, `location`, `deviceinfo`, `open_link`, `notify`, and `qr_code_scan`.

The Figma file has no local variable collections, local text styles, or local paint styles. Published values are represented as canvas frames and text. Re-read these nodes when the file may have changed:

- Page: `1:2`
- Typography: `3:15`
- Main colors: `3:141`
- Semantic colors: `3:390`
- Buttons: `3:4828`
- Text fields: `3:5032` and component set `3:5149`
- Top navigation: `3:5071`

## Conflict handling

Use Figma for web visuals and the Flutter repo for host behavior. Do not silently merge contradictions.

Known example: Figma labels `font-Caption-regular` as 12/18 with weight 400, while the inspected Flutter `TPTextStyles.caption` uses weight 600. A WebView implementation follows Figma unless the user explicitly chooses native-code parity.

The Figma canvas includes misspelled or inconsistent names, including `Font-Familiy`, `text-derection-color-Gray/400`, and two Secondary 900/950 rows whose layer names mention Primary. Preserve the verified visual value while normalizing the project-side token name; document the mapping.

## Refresh procedure

1. Inspect the local repo first. If absent, read or clone the official public repo.
2. Read the guideline pages for project setup, prerequisites, project structure, two-way connection, web connection, method contracts, and accessibility.
3. When Figma values need to be refreshed, use the connected Figma tool to inspect the exact nodes above. Record name, displayed value, node ID, and inspection date. If the tool is unavailable, keep the verified snapshot and mark unknown values instead of guessing.
4. Compare Figma against `tp_colors.dart` and `tp_text_styles.dart`. Report mismatches instead of picking a third value.
5. For a named hackathon, refresh its rule sheet separately. Record the event name and date; never overwrite permanent host or design facts with event-only requirements.
